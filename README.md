Not much to see here yet, but this is Fiewport, an **F**# Power**View** **port**.

(Yes, the name is silly.)

Fiewport is a library intended for use inside .fsx files. It provides a set of primitives useful for enumerating information from Microsoft Active Directory environments.

It includes useful filtering and manipulation functionality to quickly find the information useful to your next lateral movement or investigation.

Eventually. It's not done yet.
